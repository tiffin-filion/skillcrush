## Responsive Websites Practice Projects ##
- [File Structure](https://tiffin-filion.github.io/skillcrush/206-responsive/practice-projects/file-structure/index.html)
	- Add folders for css and images
	- Fix stylesheet name
	- Fix link to stylesheet and image
	- Fix class and ID names in stylesheet/html (remove capitalization, shorten long names, change underscores to dashes)
- [Interactive](https://tiffin-filion.github.io/skillcrush/206-responsive/practice-projects/interactive/index.html)
	- Just a sample page to see the difference between Static, Fluid, Adaptive and Responsive Website types
	- Static - fixed width that does not change (avoid)
	- Fluid - widths expressed in percentages, will expand/contract to fit the screen, does not adapt layout according to screen size (ie. 3 columns for desktop, 2 for tablet, 1 for mobile)
	- Adaptive - uses media queries to adapt the page depending on the screen size, like the number of columns to display
	- Responsive - combines fluid (resizes to screen) & adaptive (design changes based on screen size) benefits that work across all devices without having to code different versions for different screen sizes (best option)
- [Colors](https://tiffin-filion.github.io/skillcrush/206-responsive/practice-projects/colors/index.html)
	- Set different background colors for tablet & desktop using media queries (mobile is default)
