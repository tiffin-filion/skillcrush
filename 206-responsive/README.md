# colors
I just had to add different colors for each type of viewport (mobile, tablet and desktop) so you could see the change as the page size/viewport size changed. Page was created mobile first.

# breakpoint
Page was created mobile first. Add breakpoints for tablets: 768px and desktops: 1200px. Add color for each to verify they are functioning correctly.

# font-color
Page was created mobile first. Change h1, h2 and p as the page resizes from mobile to tablet to desktop.

# center-flexbox
Page was created mobile first. Utilize flexbox to center text over an image.

# center-flexbox-2
Page was created mobile first. Modify CSS so text box is centered on page, as well as the content it contains. Then changed the background, updated content box, added social icon box and made the page responsive.

# divs-flexbox
Page was created mobile first. Goal is to use flexbox to get three divs to align in a row, evenly-spaced. Then added content to divs as well as styling to the page.
