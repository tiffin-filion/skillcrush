# colors
I just had to add different colors for each type of viewport (mobile, tablet and desktop) so you could see the change as the page size/viewport size changed. Page was created mobile first.

# breakpoints
Page was created mobile first. Add breakpoints for tablets: 768px and desktops: 1200px. Add color for each to verify they are functioning correctly.

# font-colors
Page was created mobile first. Change h1, h2 and p as the page resizes from mobile to tablet to desktop.

# center-flexbox
Page was created mobile first. Utilize flexbox to center text over an image.

# center-flexbox-2
Page was created mobile first. Modify CSS so text box is centered on page, as well as the content it contains. Then changed the background, updated content box, added social icon box and made the page responsive.

# divs-flexbox
Page was created mobile first. Goal is to use flexbox to get three divs to align in a row, evenly-spaced. Then added content to divs as well as styling to the page. Added two top full-width content areas as well as a full-width footer.

# flexbox
Page with colored boxes. Had to make header, main and footer take up full width, while the three div boxes were in a row on a line with space between.

# rogue
Was given code for a desktop-first created site. Had to change it to mobile-first and add media queries for tablet and desktop using flexbox.
