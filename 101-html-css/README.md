# jubilee project
I had a bit of direction, but I started to learn how to develop a static web page from a PSD.

# rogue project
I learned how to develop a static web page with nothing but a PSD file for guidance.

# final project
I was given the choice of a few layouts and the PSD for each. I then had to recreate the page and then change the design (colors, fonts, images, content, etc) to my liking. I also added a second page that showed more projects that I've completed.
